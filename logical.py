# Example 1
x = 5
print(x > 3 and x < 10 ) # True because both thecondition are True

# Example 2
y = 12
print(y > 10 and y % == 0) #False because second condition is False

# Example 1
x = 5
print(x < 3 or x > 10) #False because both the condition are False

# Example 2
y = 12
print(y < 12 or y % == 0) #True because second condition is True
